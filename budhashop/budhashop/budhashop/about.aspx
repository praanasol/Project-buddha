<b style="font-size:16px;">About Us:</b>
<br /><br />
<p style="font-size:14px;"><b>GoVedic.com</b>  is born out of an idea that traditional way of life that prospered in ancient vedic India can be induced in morden lifestyle as an alternative. As in the name GoVedic is a term that urges you to think about Vedic traditions and follow them. Aarogya means health , Gyaan means knowledge and Vasthra means clothing. Three essentials.</p>
<br />
<p style="font-size:14px;">Firstly, the <b>Aarogya</b> section relates to the products that are made in accordance with ayurvedic practices to maintain our healthy life. Most of the products here are related to Gau (cow) . Secondly, the <b>Gyaan</b> section contains books or the material that propagate knowledge that are mainly Vedic in essence. Lastly, the <b>Vastra</b>  section relates to traditional khadi clothing and handicrafts.</p>
<br />
<b style="font-size:14px;">Why Gau (cow) products?</b><br /><br />

<p style="font-size:14px;">Health is most important part of life.Traditional practices for healthy life that  were mostly cattle oriented, importantly indigenous(Desi) cattle population. We are in brink of forgetting the importance of indigenous Gau (cow), which was responsible for prospering of Bharat(India) as a nation at that time. By encouraging Desi cow products in our lives we can revive same cattle oriented system as was earlier. If demand increases supply increases. 
</p><br />
<b style="font-size:14px;">What is Khadi?</b><br /><br />

<p style="font-size:14px;">There is a strong misconception that Khadi is only about clothing, however khadi is not only limited to clothing but anything that is handmade and provides livelihood for most marginalised people in rural India, it is a way of life. If we encourage khadi products, we would be empowering rural economy, thus paving path to the balanced development in urban and rural areas.
